KNIME nodes to read dBase files

### what is it?

This collection of nodes for the [KNIME scientific workflow engine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KNIME)
offer to open [DBase](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DBase) in KNIME. 

The collection offers nodes to read dBase files as KNIME data tables.

### how does it work?

All the smart work is done by the [DANS DBF Library](http://dans-dbf-lib.sourceforge.net/).
This code only integrates the DANS DBF library with KNIME.
